# ClassicPack-Base-IssueTracker
Issue Tracker for my Minecraft Modpack that is not hosted on GitHub.

If you want to submit a crash log, please use a Pasebin.com link.

- Always check if a bug has already been reported to avoid duplocate reports.
- Try to be as detailed as you can, tell me about the mod version you are on, if you are playing on Mac, Windows or Linux and if you are on singleplayer or multiplayer.
- Feel free to submit requests, though don't take it as a guarantee of implementation!
